## Content
This proyect contains two main files which are:
* reactable_v2.pde
* proc2pd_PROYECTO.pd
	
In addition to this there is a folder named 'amoeba_sounds'
which have the songs needed by the amoebas in our programs

## Built with
To test & run this program is needed to have:
* [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/)
* [PureData](https://puredata.info/downloads)
* [reacTIVision](http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/)
* Camera/Webcam or similar
	
## Additional libraries needed
_**Processing:**_
* [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/)
* [TUIO](https://www.tuio.org/?processing)

_**PureData:**_
* [mrpeach](https://download.puredata.info/mrpeach)
* [osc & oscx](https://puredata.info/downloads/osc)

In PureData please verify the existing paths to the 
externals folder, add a path for each lib mentioned before, 
and also add a path directly to the 'amoeba_sounds' folder.
This to ensure the correct performance of our proyect.
